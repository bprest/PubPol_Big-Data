#### Part 2: Using Scripts in RStudio
# But we want to save this stuff. So we write it all down in a script (like a do file, for those of you who have done Stata)
# Once it is written down, we can execute the lines directly from the script, either in chunks (line by line) or all at once.
# RStudio Commands:
# Run selected lines:                              Ctrl+Enter
# Run everything from the Beginning to the cursor: Ctrl+Alt+B
# Run everything from the the cursor to the End:   Ctrl+Alt+E
